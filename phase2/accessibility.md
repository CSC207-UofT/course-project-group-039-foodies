# ACCESSIBILITY ACCOMMODATIONS IN RECIPICK 

## Accessibility Accommodations present in the current programme
Equitable Use
- Simplistic design appeals to all users
- Security for all users available with a username and password login, password is hidden at login

Flexibility in Use
- User is able to go at their own pace; application will stay open and can be exited at any time

Simple and Intuitive use
- Error messages and prompts are simple; no need to reveal any internal processes, just enough information is given to the user
- Pages have ~five options to keep it simple and not overwhelm the user

Perceptible information
- Sans serif font is used for simplicity and readability 
- Adequate contrast between background and font colours, black font is almost always used against a light background and white font is used against a dark background
- Neutral colour scheme is not overwhelming for users with vision or sensory issues
- Recipes can be highlighted with cursor so that they are compatible with text-to-voice applications


Tolerance for error
- Able to go back on every page, no need to end the program and start again
- Misspelling gives an error message then takes you to the previous page so you can choose to execute the command again

Low physical effort
- There is minimal mouse movement to interact with the GUI
- Actions are simple: clicking a button and inputting text (no more than a couple words at a time)

Size and space for approach and use
- The GUI screen and text is large enough to be read comfortably


## Accessibility Accommodations that can be implemented in the future
- A screen reader can be added to the programme to accommodate persons with sight impairments.
- Move all actions to the same window instead of having multiple windows for lower physical effort
