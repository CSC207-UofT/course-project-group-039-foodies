# ACCESSIBILITY ACCOMMODATIONS IN RECIPICK 

## How ReciPick Adheres to the 7 Principles of Universal Design
Equitable Use
- Simplistic design appeals to all users
- Security for all users available with a username and password login, password is hidden at login

Flexibility in Use
- User is able to go at their own pace; application will stay open and can be exited at any time

Simple and Intuitive use
- Error messages and prompts are simple; no need to reveal any internal processes, just enough information is given to the user
- Pages have ~five options to keep it simple and not overwhelm the user

Perceptible information
- Sans serif font is used for simplicity and readability 
- Adequate contrast between background and font colours, black font is almost always used against a light background and white font is used against a dark background
- Neutral colour scheme is not overwhelming for users with vision or sensory issues
- Recipes can be highlighted with cursor so that they are compatible with text-to-voice applications


Tolerance for error
- Able to go back on every page, no need to end the program and start again
- Misspelling gives an error message then takes you to the previous page so you can choose to execute the command again

Low physical effort
- There is minimal mouse movement to interact with the GUI
- Actions are simple: clicking a button and inputting text (no more than a couple words at a time)

Size and space for approach and use
- The GUI screen and text is large enough to be read comfortably


## Accessibility Accommodations That Can Be Implemented in the Future
- A screen reader can be added to the programme to accommodate persons with sight impairments.
- Move all actions to the same window instead of having multiple windows for lower physical effort

## Who is ReciPick Marketed Towards?
We designed Recipick for several target users; food-lovers who want to up their game in the kitchen by exploring new recipes, people with several food restrictions who want new meal ideas that fit their needs and people who are busy or cooking for a family/multiple roommates that need a way to organize their diet. ReciPick pulls data from the Spoonacular API which has over 5000 recipes for food-lovers to try out. Also, users are able to set preferences to omit or include certain ingredients from their recipe selection so people with allergies or strict diets are able to enjoy ReciPick. Finally, ReciPick allows users to organize recipes they like into labeled subrecipe books for later access, and families and roommates can join groups to share subrecipe books amongst eachother (for example, a group can create a shared subrecipe book called "Sunday Dinner").
