"Ramen","lunch","1","","Sesame oil\nOlive oil (or avocado oil)\nGarlic\nFresh ginger\nChicken or vegetable broth\nRice vinegar\nLow sodium soy sauce\nSriracha or hot chili garlic sauce, like Sambal Oelek\nShredded carrots\nShiitake mushrooms (optional)\nScallions\nSesame seeds\nSoft-boiled egg \n\nHeat sesame oil and olive oil in a medium-large saucepan over moderate heat (see notes). Add garlic and ginger, and simmer until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Do not brown the garlic, or else you'll get a bitter flavor. Add the carrots and mushrooms if you're using them, and simmer until they soften, about a minute, stirring frequently. Add the broth, Sriracha sauce, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. Stir, and bring to a simmer; let it go for about five minutes. Taste, and adjust heat and taste to your liking by adding more Sriracha and soy sauce if needed. While the broth simmers, cook the Ramen noodles in a separate pot as per the package's instructions. (You could cook the noodles in the broth directly, but that makes for a messy transfer to a bowl. It's much easier to transfer drained cooked noodles to a bowl and spoon the broth over top.) Once the noodles are tender, drain and rinse under cool water, place into a soup bowl, and set aside. When the soup is ready, spoon the broth over the noodles. Allow to cool. At this point, make your soft-boiled egg if you're garnishing with one, and add the rest of your toppings to serve. Soft-Boiled Egg - Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the egg(s), and let them boil for five minutes. In the meantime, prepare an ice bath in a bowl. Once five minutes are up, remove the egg(s) and dunk them into the ice bath for about a minute to cool them off enough to handle. Then, lightly crack and roll them on a flat surface, peel, slice in half, and place on top of your Ramen."

Bring up the end closest to you, fold over the filling, and pinch the edges together to seal. Make sure youve gently pressed the wrapper around the filling so there are no air pockets.\nStand up your little triangle pocket so that the filling side sits on your work surface. Fold the top point down, away from you, and pinch. Now, give the edges on either side of that fold 2 little pleats and pinch. Your pot sticker will now look like it has wings. Place it on a large plate thats been dusted with a bit of cornstarch, to prevent sticking.  (Traditionally, pot stickers are made with round dumpling wrappers, so if you have them, you can skip the part about folding the top point down.)\nHeat the skillet over medium-high heat. Brush just a few drops of oil onto the hot pan surface, and place 12 of the pot stickers, upright, into the pan. Allow the bottoms to brown. Carefully add 1/2 cup water to the pan and cover it quickly. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed. Remove the pot stickers immediately to another plate to keep warm, and repeat the procedure with the rest of the uncooked ones.\n*Feel like you have to have meat? Substitute 4 oz. of ground chicken (or pork, if you must) for half of the mushrooms, just dont run it through the food processor. Mix the processed ingredients with the ground chicken thoroughly and fill the wrappers as before. Add a full cup of water (instead of 1/2 cup) to the pan, and steam until the water evaporates, about 5-6 minutes."
