# Specification

Our team aims to create a programme that is geared towards _food lovers_ looking to make delicious, nutritious foods right in their kitchen.
* The programme is able to **match users to recipes based on a series of their preferences**. Matches may be made based on likes/ dislikes, dietary restrictions and more. If no preferences is provided, these matches may also be made randomly.
* Recommendations are done by filtering recipes from our database using the preferences provided to find the recipe that is the best match.
* In the programme, users can : 
  * create folders of recipes that they would like to save, that is, create their own personal recipe book.
  * create groups where they can view recipes that fit everyones' preferences, as well as, share the recipes they like to members of a group.
  * create their own recipes and upload it to the database
  * rate recipes that they have tried
* The programme also has a feature where data from all users can be aggregated, analysed and be presented in the form of:
  * most popular recipes in certain categories
  * most highly rated recipes 
  * recipes rising in popularity
