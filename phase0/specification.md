Our team aims to create a programme that is geared towards _food lovers_ looking to make delicious, nutritious foods right in their kitchen.

* Recommendations are done by filtering recipes from our database using the preferences provided to find the recipe that is the best match.
* Users can create folders of recipes that they would like to save, that is, create their own personal recipe book.
* Users can also share the recipes to members of a group.
